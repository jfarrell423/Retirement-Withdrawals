Retirement-Widthdrawals

Portable Web Application to calculate montly widthdrawals from an retirement account.

How to run it on your phone (Android)

You’ve got two options:

Option A (simplest): run it directly

Copy the folder to your phone (Downloads or any folder).

Open index.html in your browser.

✅ Works immediately.
⚠️ Offline caching (service worker) may not work from file:// on some phones, but the calculator still works fine.

Option B (best): install it like an app (true PWA + offline)

For the installable/offline version, the files need to be served over https (or from localhost). Easiest ways:

Put the folder on any simple web hosting you control (even free static hosting).

Or run a tiny local server from a PC on your home network and open it once on your phone, then “Add to Home screen.”

Once installed, it launches like a normal app and works offline.
